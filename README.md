# HARC Platform / Space Force Mission Control 2050 
## Version 0.2.7 - Modular Solver, ARC-AGI Prize Compliance & Platform Restructure (September 18, 2025)

### 🚀 Release Highlights (v0.2.x)
- **Platform Pivot to HARC** – `/` now loads the HARC research experience. Space-Force content lives under `/space-force/*`. Added `HARCPuzzleBrowser.tsx` and streamlined puzzle flow (assessment → comparison → practice).
- **Modular Puzzle Solver (Phases 3-5)** – Replaced 1075-line `ResponsivePuzzleSolver.tsx` with lean container `HARCResponsiveSolverUI.tsx`, four presentational components, custom hooks, robust error boundary, and >90 % test coverage.
- **ARC-AGI 2-Attempt Limit** – Full prize-rules enforcement via CloudScript `AttemptTrackingService`, client `attemptTracker.ts`, and UI badges.
- **Strategy Sharing & 10 K Bonus** – Success modals now allow users to publish solutions. CloudScript `AwardStrategyBonus` grants 10 000 points for the first valid submission.
- **HARC Leaderboard** – Ranks players across all 1 920+ ARC puzzles using real `finalScore` data. ParticipantDashboard shows rich stats.
- **Security & Scoring Fixes** – Patched infinite-score exploit, added smart completion detection, duplicate prevention, and hardened CloudScript.
- **Service-Layer Refactor** – Introduced `cacheManager`, `arcExplainerClient`, `playfabPuzzleClient`, and `puzzleRepository`, eliminating ~3 000 duplicate lines.
- **Validation Resilience** – Automatic client-side fallback keeps validations working during CloudScript outages and logs fallback usage.
- **ID Conversion & Data Integrity** – Bullet-proof `idConverter.validateId()` accepts any PlayFab puzzle ID format, resolving comparison page failures.
- **UX & Accessibility** – Raw numbers display mode, revamped assessment success modal, responsive layouts, performance badges, and colorblind-safe themes.

> Detailed per-version notes live in `CHANGELOG.md`.
This app is several different wrappers for the same basic core data and functionality. 

### One component is a research platform for the ARC-AGI datasets and how humans perform against AI models.  This is HARC.

### The other component is a Space Force-themed puzzle platform featuring integrated human vs AI performance comparison. 


### Both of these wrappers use the same basic architecture and this successfully unifies PlayFab and arc-explainer APIs to provide real-time performance analysis comparing human puzzle-solving abilities against state-of-the-art AI models. Built on the Abstract Reasoning Corpus (ARC) framework.

### Officer Track Setup
The Officer Track with AI-curated difficulty requires:
- **PlayFab Title Data**: 2,020 puzzles across 20 batch keys (already configured)
- **arc-explainer API**: External service providing AI performance analytics
- **Environment**: `VITE_ARC_EXPLAINER_URL` must point to your arc-explainer instance

#### Arc-Explainer API Integration
The Officer Track uses the arc-explainer API for AI difficulty analysis:

**Key Endpoint**: `/api/puzzle/worst-performing`
- **Parameters**: `limit` (max 50), `sortBy`, `minAccuracy`, `maxAccuracy`, `zeroAccuracyOnly`
- **Response**: Puzzle performance data with `avgAccuracy`, `compositeScore`, etc.
- **ID Format**: Uses raw puzzle IDs (e.g., `007bbfb7`) vs PlayFab format (`ARC-TR-007bbfb7`)

**Data Flow**:
1. PlayFab stores puzzle content (authoritative source)
2. Arc-explainer provides AI performance metadata  
3. ID conversion: `ARC-TR-007bbfb7` ↔ `007bbfb7`
4. Merged data enables difficulty-based filtering

**Available Filters**:
- `zeroAccuracyOnly=true` - Puzzles with 0% AI success rate (impossible category)
- `minAccuracy`/`maxAccuracy` - Accuracy range filtering
- `sortBy=composite` - Sort by composite difficulty score

### Documentation

📚 **See [docs/](./docs/)** for comprehensive documentation:
- **[PlayFab API Analysis](./docs/playfab-api-analysis.md)** - Complete API reference and security audit
- **[Migration Plan](./docs/2SeptPlayfabTasks.md)** - PlayFab implementation phases

⚠️ **Security Notice**: Current task validation is client-side only. See API Analysis for production security recommendations.

### Adding New Tasks

Tasks are now managed in **PlayFab Title Data**. To add new tasks:

1. Use the PlayFab dashboard to update Title Data
2. Follow the task structure shown above
3. Use numbers 0-9 in input/output arrays (emojis are mapped in the UI)
4. Tasks are loaded automatically on app refresh
5. No server restart required - it's a static site!

### Deployment

```bash
# Build static site
npm run build

# Preview production build locally  
npm start
```

Static files are deployed to Railway and served from CDN.

## Narrative Story Wrapper System  //  BEING REMOVED WITH PLAYFAB!

### Purpose
Adds a light-hearted Space-Force-2050 story layer to mundane training tasks without touching core puzzle data.

### How It Works
1. `server/data/problems.json` – Holds every narrative template.  Keys are transformation types; each array contains one template per task **category** (O₂ Sensor Check, Pre-Launch Ops, Fuel Systems, Navigation, Communications, Power Systems, Security).
2. `server/data/antagonists.json` – List of mischievous characters (e.g. "Rick the Intern") that caused the mishap.
3. `server/data/components.json` – List of ship components the antagonist fiddled with.
4. `server/templates/storyTemplates.ts` – Loader that reads `problems.json` at runtime and exposes templates to the factory.
5. `server/tools/story-factory.ts` – Pure function that:
   - Randomly selects an antagonist + component.
   - Picks the correct template for the task’s `transformationType` + `category`.
   - Substitutes `{{antagonist}}` and `{{component}}` placeholders.
   - Returns an enriched task object ready for the API/UI.

### Updating Stories (Writers-Friendly)
- Open `server/data/problems.json`.
- Find the transformation type you want (e.g. `rotation_90deg`).
- Add or edit an object in the array with fields: `id`, `category`, `title`, `description`.
- Keep it short (<60-char title, <180-char description) and include placeholders where relevant.
- No code changes are needed – the loader will pick it up automatically.

## AI Failure Content System

### Purpose
Provides humorous and educational content about why AI struggles with different transformation types, adding both entertainment value and educational insights to tasks.

### AI Failure Data Structure
The `server/data/ai_failure.json` file contains content for each transformation type:

```json
{
  "transformation_type": {
    "ai_difficulty": "Technical explanation of why AI struggles with this transformation",
    "comic_situation1": "Humorous scenario showing AI failing at the transformation",
    "comic_situation2": "Another humorous scenario",
    "comic_situation3": "A third humorous scenario",
    "kids_explanation": "Simple explanation for younger players about why the transformation is hard for AI",
    "kids_explanation1": "Second simple explanation",
    "kids_explanation2": "Third simple explanation"
  }
}
```

### Transformation Types Covered
- `horizontal_reflection`: Mirror flips left-to-right
- `vertical_reflection`: Mirror flips top-to-bottom
- `rotation_90deg`: 90° clockwise rotation
- `rotation_270deg`: 270° clockwise (or 90° counter-clockwise) rotation
- `pattern_completion`: Logical sequence pattern completion

### Using the AI Failure Content
- Use the `scripts/enhance-tasks.js` script to automatically enhance task descriptions and hints with this content
- The enhancement script:
  1. Detects the transformation type used in each task
  2. Prepends a random comic situation and AI difficulty explanation to the task's description
  3. Adds the three kids_explanation entries to the beginning of the hints array
- For tasks that don't follow standard transformation naming patterns, manual enhancement is recommended

### Updating AI Failure Content
- Edit `server/data/ai_failure.json` to modify existing content
- Maintain the structure of each transformation type entry
- When adding new transformation types, ensure all seven fields are included
- After updating, re-run the enhancement script to apply changes to task files

---

## Future Enhancements
